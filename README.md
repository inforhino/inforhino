## Introduction to our repository on data droppable websites

We have been working on a variety of technologies around data and have recently released our [Web Data Platform](https://www.inforhino.co.uk/products/web-data-platform) . Whilst this is a proprietary product we are very keen to work with other collaborators in this area.

We are currently in the process of automating our data processing for an initial launch of crypto statto - a new cryptocurrency analytics plaform. We expect to see this launched May 2023.

We expect to upload a few ASP.Net Core (dotnetcore) opensource projects demonstrating how this approach works from March 2022 onwards.

If you are interested in this, content is starting to appear across the internet discussing the benefits of making websites data ready.
